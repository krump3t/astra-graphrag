# Task 017 Compliance Evaluation Report (UPDATED)
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Protocol Version:** v12.1
**Evaluator:** SCA Compliance Validator
**Last Updated:** Post-migration to correct directory

## Executive Summary
Task 017 ("ground-truth-failure-domain") is **CRITICALLY NON-COMPLIANT** with Protocol v12.1. The task has multiple severe violations that require immediate remediation before it can proceed. Task has been successfully migrated to the correct directory structure.

## Status: **BLOCKED**

## Critical Violations (Immediate Failures)

### 1. **DCI Loop Violation - CRITICAL**
- **Missing:** `artifacts/run_log.txt`
- **Impact:** Complete failure of DCI adherence requirement
- **Protocol Reference:** Section 1.4, Section 2
- **Consequence:** No audit trail of execution, no evidence of infrastructure usage

### 2. **Directory Structure Issue** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Task was in wrong location (`astra-graphrag/tasks/` instead of `tasks/`)
- **Resolution:** Successfully migrated to `tasks/017-ground-truth-failure-domain/`
- **Status:** All files and directories successfully copied to correct location

### 3. **Missing QA Artifacts**
**Required but Missing:**
- `qa/lizard_report.txt` - Complexity analysis
- `qa/bandit.json` - Security scan
- `qa/secrets.baseline` - Secrets detection

**Partially Present:**
- `qa/coverage.xml` - EXISTS (only QA artifact present)

### 4. **Infrastructure Version Mismatch**
- **Deployed:** v12.0 (in `.gemini/sca_infrastructure/`)
- **Required:** v12.1 (per protocol)
- **Impact:** May lack critical enforcement features

## Progress Assessment

### Current State
- **Phase:** 2 (Design & Tooling) per state.json
- **Status:** "ok" (incorrectly marked - should be "blocked")
- **Critical Path:** Defined (4 files identified)
- **Context Gate:** Claims all files present (needs verification)

### Work Completed
1. Context files created (hypothesis.md, design.md, etc.)
2. Critical Path defined in state.json
3. Some directory structure created
4. Partial QA artifact (coverage.xml only)

### Work Missing/Invalid
1. No DCI execution trail (run_log.txt)
2. No evidence of infrastructure usage
3. Incomplete QA artifacts
4. No test files visible
5. No source code in src/ directory

## Compliance Gates Status

| Gate | Status | Evidence | Action Required |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **DCI Adherence** | ❌ FAILED | No run_log.txt | Create and populate run_log.txt |
| **Artifacts** | ❌ FAILED | 3/4 missing | Generate all QA artifacts |
| **Coverage** | ⚠️ UNKNOWN | XML exists, CP coverage unclear | Validate coverage on CP |
| **TDD** | ❌ FAILED | No test files found | Create tests with @pytest.mark.cp |
| **Complexity** | ❌ FAILED | No lizard_report.txt | Run complexity analysis |
| **Security** | ❌ FAILED | No bandit.json or secrets.baseline | Run security scans |
| **Hygiene** | ⚠️ UNKNOWN | No requirements.txt or .gitignore found | Create hygiene files |
| **Context** | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Files claimed but not verified | Verify data_sources.json has sha256/PII |

## Task 018 Impact Assessment

### Current Situation
- **Task 018:** EXISTS at `astra-graphrag/tasks/018-production-remediation/`
- **Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Hypothesis Validation)
- **Status:** BLOCKED (same infrastructure issue as Task 017)
- **Dependencies:** Task 018 explicitly states `"task_017": "no_conflict (verified)"`
- **Interference Risk:** **NONE** - Already verified by Task 018 team

### Key Findings
- Task 018 HAS a `run_log.txt` (better DCI compliance than Task 017)
- Task 018 shares the same blocker: missing `sca_infrastructure/runner.py`
- Both tasks blocked by Protocol v12.1 infrastructure requirements
- Task 018 is 43% complete with 5.0 hours invested

### Remediation Impact
- **No interference confirmed** - Task 018 has already verified no conflicts
- Both tasks can be remediated independently
- Both need same infrastructure fix (deploy v12.1 infrastructure)
- Task 018 is also in wrong parent directory (`astra-graphrag/tasks/` vs `tasks/`)

## Required Remediation Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. ✅ **Relocate Task Files** - COMPLETED
   - Successfully migrated from `astra-graphrag/tasks/` to `tasks/017-ground-truth-failure-domain/`

2. **Initialize DCI Compliance**
   ```bash
   python .gemini/sca_infrastructure/runner.py task register --id=017 --slug=ground-truth-failure-domain
   ```

3. **Create run_log.txt with Proper Format**
   - Add DCI markers ([DCI-1], [DCI-2], [DCI-3])
   - Log all commands with verbatim output
   - Include timestamps

### Infrastructure Actions (Priority 2)
1. **Update Infrastructure to v12.1**
   ```bash
   python -c "exec(open('.claude/full_protocol.md').read().split('### EMBEDDED_INFRA_START')[1].split('### EMBEDDED_INFRA_END')[0])"
   ```

2. **Generate Missing QA Artifacts**
   ```bash
   python sca_infrastructure/runner.py generate-qa-artifacts --task-id=017-ground-truth-failure-domain
   ```

### Validation Actions (Priority 3)
1. **Run Full Validation Suite**
   ```bash
   python sca_infrastructure/runner.py validate all --task-id=017-ground-truth-failure-domain
   ```

2. **Verify Critical Path Coverage**
   ```bash
   python sca_infrastructure/discovery/critical_path.py --task-id=017-ground-truth-failure-domain
   ```

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy v12.1 infrastructure immediately** - Both tasks need this
2. **Migrate Task 018 to correct directory** - Currently in `astra-graphrag/tasks/`
3. **Create run_log.txt for Task 017** with proper DCI markers
4. **Generate missing QA artifacts** for both tasks using infrastructure
5. **Use infrastructure commands exclusively** - no direct execution
6. **Consider batch remediation** - Both tasks share same blockers

## Conclusion

**Task 017 Status:** CRITICALLY NON-COMPLIANT (missing run_log.txt, incomplete QA artifacts)
- ✅ Successfully migrated to correct directory
- ❌ Still missing DCI audit trail and most QA artifacts

**Task 018 Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLIANT but BLOCKED (has run_log.txt but wrong location)
- ✅ Has DCI audit trail (run_log.txt)
- ❌ In wrong directory structure
- ❌ Missing v12.1 infrastructure

**Key Finding:** Task 018 has already verified no conflict with Task 017. Both tasks can be remediated independently but share the same infrastructure blocker (missing sca_infrastructure/runner.py v12.1).

**Both tasks remain BLOCKED until Protocol v12.1 infrastructure is deployed.**
