"""
Critical Path E2E Tests for GraphRAG Workflow (TDD - RED Phase)

Protocol: SCA v9-Compact
Requirements:
1. Real API integration (NO MOCKS - genuine computation only)
2. Held-out test set validation (50 Q&A pairs, stratified by query type)
3. End-to-end workflow (embed → retrieve → reason)
4. Differential tests (input deltas → output deltas)
5. Statistical validation (binomial test for accuracy, t-test for latency)

Critical Path Components (from hypothesis.md):
- services/langgraph/workflow.py (build_workflow, embed, retrieve, reason)
- services/graph_index/astra_api.py (real AstraDB vector search)
- services/graph_index/graph_traverser.py (real graph traversal)
- services/graph_index/embedding.py (real embedding client)
- services/graph_index/generation.py (real LLM generation)
- services/mcp/glossary_scraper.py + glossary_cache.py (real scraping/caching)
