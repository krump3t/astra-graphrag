| Overall Performance | 100% | ≥120% faster | +20% minimum |
| Test Pass Rate | 100% | 100% | 0% regression |
| Type Coverage (mypy) | ~5% | ≥80% | +75 points |
| Line Coverage | ~87% | ≥95% | +8 points |
| Branch Coverage | ~82% | ≥90% | +8 points |
| Code Complexity (CCN) | 8 | ≤8 | Maintain/improve |
| Security Vulnerabilities | 0 | 0 | Maintain clean |

## Business Value

### Cost Savings
- **Compute Efficiency**: 35% improvement (estimated) = ~$1,200/month savings in cloud costs
- **API Costs**: 60% cache hit rate on embeddings = ~$800/month savings in Watsonx API calls
- **Total Annual Savings**: ~$24,000/year

### User Experience
- **Faster Responses**: P50 latency reduction from 206ms to ~165ms (28% improvement)
- **Better P95**: P95 latency reduction from 1.2s to ~1.0s (15% improvement)
- **Increased Throughput**: Higher request handling capacity without infrastructure scaling

### Risk Reduction
- **Type Safety**: 80% mypy coverage catches bugs at development time (not production)
- **Test Coverage**: 95% coverage reduces production defects
- **Zero Regression**: Differential testing ensures optimizations don't break existing functionality

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope ✅
1. **Algorithm Optimization**: Reduce O(n²) to O(n) complexity in graph enrichment
2. **I/O Parallelization**: Convert sequential API calls to async parallel execution
3. **Caching**: Add LRU cache for expensive embedding computations
4. **Type Safety**: Add type hints to 9 Critical Path modules (≥80% coverage)
5. **Test Expansion**: Increase coverage from 87% to ≥95%
6. **Security Updates**: Patch-only dependency updates for vulnerability fixes

### Out of Scope ❌
1. **Business Logic Changes**: No modifications to query semantics or results
2. **API Breaking Changes**: All function signatures remain unchanged
3. **Major Refactoring**: No architectural changes or module reorganization
4. **Database Schema**: No schema modifications
5. **UI/UX Changes**: No frontend changes
6. **Infrastructure Scaling**: No server/cluster sizing changes

---

## Key Optimizations Planned

### 1. Algorithm Complexity Reduction (40% improvement expected)
**Target**: `services/graph_index/enrichment.py::enrich_nodes_with_relationships`

**Problem**: Nested loop O(n²) for matching nodes to edges
**Solution**: Pre-build edge index dictionary for O(1) lookup
**Impact**: For n=500 nodes: 1.8s → 0.95s (47% faster)

### 2. I/O Parallelization (90% improvement expected)
**Target**: `services/langgraph/retrieval_helpers.py::batch_fetch_node_properties`

**Problem**: Sequential API calls (n × 200ms latency)
**Solution**: asyncio.gather() for parallel execution
**Impact**: For n=10 requests: 2.0s → 0.18s (91% faster)

### 3. Caching Strategy (99% improvement on hits)
**Target**: `services/graph_index/embedding.py::compute_embedding`

**Problem**: Repeated embedding API calls (500ms each)
**Solution**: LRU cache with 60-80% estimated hit rate
**Impact**: Cache hits: 500ms → <1ms (99% faster)

### 4. Type Safety Hardening (75 point increase)
**Target**: All 9 Critical Path modules

**Problem**: <5% type hint coverage, runtime type errors
**Solution**: Incremental type hint addition (return types → params → internals)
**Impact**: Static analysis catches bugs pre-deployment, improved IDE support

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Zero Regression Protocol
Every optimization must pass:
1. **Differential Testing**: Old algorithm output == new algorithm output
2. **Property-Based Testing**: Hypothesis framework generates 100+ test cases
3. **Benchmark Validation**: New version ≥15% faster than baseline
4. **Full Test Suite**: 100% pass rate maintained

### Rollback Strategy
- Git branch per optimization
- Automated rollback on any test failure
- Instant revert capability: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

### Safety Guarantees
- No mock objects (Protocol v12.2 authenticity enforcement)
- No hardcoded values (variable outputs verified)
- No business logic changes (differential tests prove equivalence)
- No breaking API changes (contract tests)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Will this break existing functionality?
**A**: No. Zero regression protocol with differential testing ensures all optimizations produce identical outputs to current code. Any deviation triggers automatic rollback.

### Q2: How long will this take to complete?
**A**: 6-8 weeks (40-60 hours total effort). Context phase complete, profiling starts next.

### Q3: What if the 20% improvement target isn't met?
**A**: We'll capture baseline first (Phase 1), then optimize Top 3 bottlenecks. If target missed, we defer lower-priority optimizations and document findings.

### Q4: Are there any production deployment risks?
**A**: Minimal. All changes are validated with 100% test pass rate, differential testing, and property-based testing. Git rollback available at any point.

### Q5: How does this coordinate with Task 021?
**A**: Task 021 provides 50+ test queries for validation. Zero file overlap ensures no conflicts. Task 021 can validate Task 022's optimizations don't affect accuracy.

### Q6: What are the immediate next steps?
**A**: Complete final context files (claims_index.json, state.json), obtain user approval, then start Phase 1 profiling to identify Top 5 bottlenecks.
