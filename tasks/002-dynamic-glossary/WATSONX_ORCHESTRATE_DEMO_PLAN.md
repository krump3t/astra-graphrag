**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "term": "XYZ123FAKE",
  "error": "Definition not found for 'XYZ123FAKE' in any source",
  "sources_tried": ["slb", "spe", "aapg", "static"],
  "cached": false
}
```

**Demo Talking Points**:
- ✅ Graceful failure (no crashes)
- ✅ Transparent about sources checked
- ✅ Suggests no definition exists

### B. Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Tool not appearing in watsonx.orchestrate | MCP server not registered | Re-import MCP server in Agent Builder |
| Response timeout | Network latency or graph query complexity | Increase timeout to 30s, optimize query |
| Glossary definition not found | Term not in SLB/SPE/AAPG | Add to static glossary as fallback |
| File access denied | Path outside data/ directory | Use relative path: `15-9-13.las` not `/abs/path` |
| Cache not working | Redis connection failed | Check Redis status, fallback to in-memory cache |
| Unit conversion fails | Unsupported unit pair | Check CONVERSION_FACTORS dict, add if needed |
