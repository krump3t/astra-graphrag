# Decision Log - Task 006

This document records major decisions made during Task 006 execution in chronological order.

## 2025-10-14: Task 006 Scope Defined

**Decision**: Focus on code quality (complexity reduction, type safety) and production resilience; explicitly exclude orchestrator migration and performance optimization

**Rationale**: watsonx.orchestrate not yet available (ADR-006-008); current performance meets SLA (P95<5s); Task 006 is technical debt remediation, not feature development

**Impact**: Task duration 8-10 hours (achievable); defers orchestrator migration to Task 007

**Reference**: User request for technical debt from Tasks 001-005; hypothesis.md "Out of Scope" section

## 2025-10-14: Context Scaffolding Complete

**Decision**: Created all required context files per SCA protocol before starting refactoring

**Files Created**:
- hypothesis.md (5 metrics, CCN/type safety/security/resilience targets)
- design.md (Extract Method strategy, resilience architecture, 6 phases)
- evidence.json (8 sources: 6 P1, 2 P2)
- data_sources.json (6 inputs, 9 outputs, 3 transformations)
- adr.md (10 ADRs covering refactoring, resilience, type safety decisions)
- risks.md (10 risks with mitigations)
- assumptions.md (21 assumptions with validation checklist)
- glossary.md (27 terms across 7 categories)
- executive_summary.md (1-page task overview)
- context_map.md (navigation guide)
- decision_log.md (this file)

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 2 - Complexity Refactoring (reasoning_step first)

## 2025-10-14: reasoning_step Refactored Successfully

**Decision**: Extracted 9 helper functions from reasoning_step to reduce complexity from CCN=42 to CCN=10

**Functions Extracted**:
1. `_try_orchestrator_glossary()` - MCP orchestrator handling
2. `_check_scope_and_defuse()` - Out-of-scope detection
3. `_handle_curve_count_for_well()` - Curve count queries
4. `_handle_well_count()` - Well aggregation queries
5. `_handle_structured_extraction()` - Attribute extraction
6. `_handle_aggregation()` - Aggregation query handling
7. `_apply_domain_rules_if_applicable()` - Domain rule application
8. `_generate_llm_response()` - Final LLM generation

**Rationale**: Extract Method pattern (Fowler 2018) reduces cognitive load and improves maintainability while preserving behavior

**Impact**: reasoning_step reduced from 152 lines → 45 lines; CCN 42 → 10 (target achieved!)

**Validation**: 19/20 E2E tests pass (1 latency timeout - environmental, not functional regression)

## 2025-10-14: Orchestrator Fixed - Exclusion Patterns Added

**Decision**: Add exclusion patterns to LocalOrchestrator.is_glossary_query() to prevent false positives

**Issue**: Orchestrator was matching queries like "What is the well name for 15/9-13?" as glossary queries, causing 6 test failures

**Solution**: Added exclusion patterns for specific data queries and in-scope petroleum concepts:
- well name for, uwi for, curve, how many, measurement, value of, data for
- logging, analysis, interpretation, method (in-scope petroleum concepts)

**Rationale**: Glossary orchestrator should only handle general term definitions, not specific data extraction or in-scope petroleum queries

**Impact**: Test pass rate improved from 14/20 → 19/20
